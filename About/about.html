  <p> As Trinity offensive linemen, we pride ourselfs on being tough. We are a different breed, we dominate our opponets. Coach Mancini has preached dominance to us every day for over three years, it is in our blood and it is our way of life. We enjoy destroying our opponets and making them feel cheap. We pride ourselfs on our pancake numbers and we compete each year to see who is the meanest player. We do nothing ilegal but we play nasty and agressive between the whistles in a dominating fashion. We base our platoon on the story of the 300 spartains. We are a small but dominate force that will destroy any enemy that we face. We have faced much larger and stronger enemies than us, but our competitvie spirit and our will to win are what sets us apart from the others. We believe that practice habits make game habits so we work hard in practice, the weight room, and in film study so we can dominate our oponents on the field. We dominate as a unit, and it showed in our first game this year where we made our rival Jackson Christian feel cheap in a 54-0 game. This past year we averaged 35 points per game, scored 106 points in our first two games, averaged 214.8 rushing yards per game, rushed for 32 touchdowns, and threw for 18 touchdowns.</p>
